# Project Name: Covid-19-Analysis-Report
This dataset presents a detailed global analysis of COVID-19, spanning from January, 2020, to March, 2023. It includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The data is further categorized by year, month, and day, providing a granular view of the progression of the pandemic in during this period.

------
# Project objective: Problem Satement
In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need to analyze and understand the patterns of infection, mortality, and recovery across different countries to identify trends, assess the effectiveness of public health measures, and inform future strategies for pandemic preparedness and response.

------------
# Data Sourcing:
This data was sourced from the COVID-19 GitHub Data: https://aka.ms/30DLCOVID19GitHubData. It contains a time series summary of covid-19 since it was first discovered.

--------
# Data Cleaning:
To ensure accuracy and the reliability of the analysis, the data was scrapped to microsoft excel and further cleaned and manipulated using power query editor. Year, Month and Day columns were introduced in Excel to allow for time intellegince when analyzing.

# Findings And Recommendations:
The United States has the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases, contributing approximately 17% of the global total and 40% of the Top 5 (US, India, Germany, France, Brazil). This indicates a significant burden of the disease within the country.

North Korea has reported a relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, with only 300 reported cases. This suggests potential challenges in data reporting or limited testing and surveillance within the country. This could also emphasis that the government and heath workers were able to curtail the spread of the virus.

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally is exceptionally high, reaching over 316 billion. This underscores the widespread impact of the pandemic on a global scale.

Despite the high number of confirmed cases, the death rate remains relatively low at 1.39%. This indicates that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 are surviving, although there are still significant mortality impacts globally.

The highest recorded number of cases occurred in 2022, with a cumulative total of approximately 200 billion cases. This highlights the severity of the pandemic during that period.

### Recommendations
Vaccination Campaigns: Prioritize and accelerate vaccination efforts globally to achieve widespread immunity and reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Ensure equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries, including those with limited access to healthcare resources.

Enhanced Surveillance and Testing: Improve surveillance systems and testing capabilities, particularly in countries with low reported prevalence like North Korea, to accurately assess the extent of the pandemic and implement appropriate control measures.

Public Health Measures: Continue promoting and enforcing public health measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Encourage compliance with guidelines to reduce transmission rates.

Healthcare Capacity: Strengthen healthcare systems and increase capacity to manage and treat COVID-19 cases, including provision of necessary medical supplies, equipment, and trained personnel. Prepare for potential future surges in cases.

Data Transparency: Ensure transparency and accuracy in reporting COVID-19 data globally to facilitate informed decision-making and effective public health responses. Encourage countries to share data openly and collaborate in monitoring and controlling the pandemic.

Research and Development: Invest in research and development of therapeutics, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19 to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the impact of the disease. Support international collaboration and funding for research efforts.

Community Engagement: Engage communities through education, communication, and outreach programs to increase awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures and dispel misinformation. Foster community resilience and support networks to cope with the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.
